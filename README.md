## Description

During this particular week, I undertook the task of developing an SVG file generator leveraging the Inquirer npm package alongside the object-oriented programming (OOP) principles I acquired in class. The initial steps of the application involve prompting the user to select a shape, choose its color, input the desired text, and decide on the text color. Subsequently, the program processes these selections and dynamically generates the corresponding SVG logo tailored to the user's preferences.

While engaging in this challenge, I encountered some minor setbacks primarily due to my diligent preparation. Nevertheless, I identified an area where I could further enhance my skillsâ€”creating specific use cases for each shape. Despite these challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed the process and eagerly anticipate tackling the forthcoming challenges that lie ahead!
